## Editing

I strongly recommend use of Latex Workshop extension in VS Code.

To use it, you will need to install LaTeX, here are more detailed 
instructions: https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install 

If you have compilation issues after installation, this is probably due to missing packages. Simply install the full version of your latex distribution of choice. 

For Debian/Ubuntu, it is: 
sudo apt-get install texlive-full 

For fedora: 
Please follow these docs https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/neurofedora/latex/


Alternatively, one can use overleaf to work on TeX files and add changes to git repo manually.
